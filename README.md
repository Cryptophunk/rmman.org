This website is a super simple flat HTML site that is hosted (for free) using GitHub Pages. 
Just copy the content out of index.html and swap out the Google Doc URL from the script at the bottom.

The page uses javascript to pull in the HTML of a Google Doc and display the `#content` div.

If the page can't pull the content it instead loads an iframe of the content.

## Preparing the Google Doc

In the doc you want to use as your page content go to `file > publish` and publish the doc.
