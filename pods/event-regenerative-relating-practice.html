                <p>
                    Each Monday from 6:30-8:30pm MST, we are facilitating a call for both new & experienced people to practice the basics of
                    truthful, regenerative relating. The call is also an opportunity to meet others in the project and get to know each
                    other in meaningful ways.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    All are welcome! Whether or not you are interested in being part of a pod, you are welcome to join us. Come once or
                    twice to check it out, join sporadically, or attend on a regular basis.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It will serve as an introduction to the pod project and a practice space for the kinds of relating that lead to deep
                    trust, connectedness, and cooperativeness.
