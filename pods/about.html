                <h2 class="title">About the Rocky Mountain Pod Project</h2>
                <p>
                    In early 2020, within the Rocky Mountain Mutual Aid Network, an idea was planted to create resilient neighborhood
                    groups. This idea has sprouted and grown into the Rocky Mountain Pod Project. We believe that <strong>a culture of 
                    belonging is the foundation of deep systemic health</strong>. We’ve noticed a problem across many groups that we’ve been a part of: <strong>
                    they lacksufficient resources for connective intelligence</strong>. We have seen so many small groups fall apart or struggle due to
                    interpersonal challenges, embodied shame, or burnout that could have been avoided if the people involved could have
                    practiced more honesty and vulnerability with each other.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    So, we decided to focus on <strong>providing training and support to help small groups develop their connective intelligence</strong>. We
                    believe that if we are to reshape our socio-economic system to be regenerative, rather than degenerative, we must start
                    with our relationships.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    To achieve this, we are bringing together the tools of authentic relating, sustainability, activism, and mutual aid. We
                    believe that <strong>relational technologies are absolutely essential but often lack an explicit connection to social or
                    environmental change</strong>. We believe that activities centered around <strong>social and environmental justice have their intentions
                    in the right place but often express toxic relationship dynamics</strong> that cause unnecessary pain and failure.

                <p>By cultivating a culture of deep relational connectedness, truthfulness, and mutual support (both emotionally and
                materially), we can create a society where everyone is genuinely taken care of, where no one is left behind, and where
                the emotional and physical wellbeing of every human and non-human is tended to and supported.</p>
