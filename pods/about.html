                <h2 class="title">About the Rocky Mountain Pod Project</h2>
                <p>
                    In early 2020 as the Rocky Mountain Mutual Aid Network and idea was planted to create resilient neighborhood groups.
                    This idea has sprouted in the Rocky Mountain Pod Project. We believe that <strong>a culture of belonging is the foundation of
                        deep systemic health</strong>. We noticed a problem across many groups weâ€™ve been a part of, <strong>we lack sufficient connective
                        intelligence resources</strong>. We have seen so many small groups fall apart due to interpersonal issues, embodied shame, and
                    burn that could have been avoided if we could just be a little better at being honest, vulnerable, and open with each
                    other.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    So we decided to focus on <strong>providing training and support to help small groups develop their connective intelligence</strong>. We
                    believe that if we are to reshape our socio-economic system to be regenerative, rather than degenerative, we must start
                    with our relationships.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    To achieve this we are bringing together tools such as Authentic Relating, activism, and mutual aid. We believe that
                    <strong>relating technologies are valuable but often lack an explicit social justice purpose</strong>. We believe that <strong>social justice
                        activities have their heart in the right place but often express toxic relationship dynamics</strong> that cause unnecessary pain
                    and failure.
