                <p>
                    We are supporting people to create or join small groups (pods) of 3 to 8 people who develop real, ongoing relationships
                    with each other, practice mutual aid together, and/or engage in a shared project. We believe that honest, healthy
                    relationships lead to the highest possible levels of resiliency and wellbeing for communities and their members. We call
                    this way of being together “regenerative relating.”
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Rather than a rapid response to crisis, mutual aid—with genuine relational connectedness at its foundation—can become a
                    sustainable and joyful way of life.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Pods provide a way to enact this potential.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    We are providing tools, resources, and direct support for people to join or start a pod or bring an existing group into
                    our network. You’ll find descriptions and links to submission forms for each of these options below.
